As the owner of this project, I was responsible for the product design and automation development using PERL and PL/SQL; meanwhile, my teammate developed UI that allows leadership to implement changes easily. This innovative digital transformation project saved an estimated $330K a year from the elimination of over 3K man-hours in repetitive tasks of sampling increment. It encourages efficient resource allocation and reduce opportunity for human error.`,
